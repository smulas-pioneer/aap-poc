- Separator for thousands (locale)
- Validation button always available
- Export in excel for the order list  (logo)
- Add isin code next to security name on main screen (dashboard)
- Sharing button (contextual content, eg: export to excel/pdf/image, print, etc..) - placed next to search (header)
- Open pdf after generation checkbox ( default to unchecked, should can be user pref. )
. Add operation column to holdings (same as order list)
- Radar: gray color unchecked. (remove the checked icons)
  - when appear, show the alert icons otherwise nothing.
  - default state of alters view is actual, add switch from actuals/proposals
- My alerts:
