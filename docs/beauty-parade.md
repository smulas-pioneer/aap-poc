 ** || for every proposal, if the client does not want a security, we have to provide a list of equivalent  securities he can choose (based on micro asset class). then you have to simulate again. If I change, the machine will compute the amount to have the same weight . suggested to use the search with the filter on the asset class and organised by priority (with an icon to open the window) ’69’
*** || client constraints
