# Advisory Platform v2

Set of ideas coming after the meeting with Unicredit and other thinking.

## Unicredit Feedback

- Manager dashboard, to add analytics breakdown.
- ??? on both screen’s header and tab’s footer and but also the radar one (in absolute and as such without comparison to model portfolio)
- Manager dashboard, to add revenues, new cash, turnover, fees (by type), budget (YTD)
- ??? Adding the country (Italy, Germany, Austria, …) selection with a global Europe view (nice to have, low priority)
- To Add High networth client segment
- To allow search by isin
- Retail simplified version (with goals)


## Amundi Feedback

- To allow filter by analytics values.
- To allow search by analytics values and improve the search widget.
